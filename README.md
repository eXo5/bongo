like bamazon but better


After user login, user is displayed a list of items from the database to order from:
![Initial Product List](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22946713/27543114-356a2d3e-5a57-11e7-8eb7-b92aa71163e0.png)

Then Customer specifies an amount of products to order, we check to see if the stock exceeds the order quantity and if it does, we confirm the order, update the stock in the database, and return the total for the products purchased.

In my opinion, this could run a whole hell of a lot better and I'm disappointed that I was only able to accomplish the first objective, especially considering how much time and effort was put into just royally screwing up javascript and sql syntax.
